#Tiny Wings Remake on Android
* Powered by [Cocos2d-X](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/) & [Box2D](http://box2d.org/)
* Inspired by and ported from [haqu / tiny-wings](https://github.com/haqu/tiny-wings)
* Runs on both Android and iOS
* Youtube demo: <http://youtu.be/4ISI_70pYGs>
* Youku demo: <http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDAwMDgyNzgw.html>

#Play with It
1. There's an .apk alongside the source code.
2. Or, you can build and run the souce code yourself. The Cocos2d-x and Box2D libs are included already. But you still need to ***modify the build_native.sh script*** so that the Android NDK recognizes the relative path for those libs on your Mac.

#Compatibility
Tested OK on my Nexus S (Android 4.0) and my iPhone 4s (iOS 5.0).
